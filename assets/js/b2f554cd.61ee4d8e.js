Hope you like\\nit! This decision came after a relatively long period of isolation (hello pandemic!), and because I thought that this could be\\na very interesting way to show the world what I can really do. Yes, it\'s a little stressful for me when I\'m showing a\\nauthoring work, but let me test myself!\\n\\nFrom now on, I will use my social media networks and this site who speaks to you to showcase my authorship works (usually,\\nunder the index page). In addition, I\'ll be writing blog posts to talk about the decisions I made on my projects,\\nsome guides explaining how I achieved the results I got, programming tutorials and some opinion posts about things\\nof my interest (usually about software development or tech-related stuff).\\n\\nAs you may have noticed, I\'m not a native English speaker (surprise, surprise!). This blog will be a great opportunity to\\nimprove my english too, so if you notice any errors (of any kind), please let me know.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks, I\'ll be posting about how I made the infrastructure of my personal website, and project websites,\\nin more detail (GitHub Pages, Custom domains and Docusaurus, basically).\\n\\nSee you soon!"}]}')}}]);
